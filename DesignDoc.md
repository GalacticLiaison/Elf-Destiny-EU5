# Elves

- Focus on Nobility
- Focus on Quality over Quantity


# New Elf Pops vs Use Existing Pop Types

*PROS*
- Help better distinguish Human vs Elf Populations

*CONS*
- Human Building wouldnt employ elves and vice versa
    - RGOs would likely be a problem too...  Although slaves work...
        - confirmed only slaves and laborers can fill RGOs

**Resolution**: Middle Ground => Lets keep all the same except make a unique peasant type
- With burghers/laborers and maybe even Nobles we can dynamically rename the pop types to represent a mix of races if needed

- will need to overwrite every single good with a new demand amount for the new pop types....
    - maybe can get away with just the ones I care about

- Also... Pop Growth may only apply to peasants... There may be no way around that



maybe have aeluran advisor be an additional free councillor!
- special options?
- make this a "rite", option for unlockable customization slot
    - actually we were thinking something like this for estate privledge
    - make Aeluran judicary additional unlockable privledge


# privledge idea
dragons greed or elven desire or something
- bans export of gold silver and mythril
- grants estate satisfaction and something else
- may be better suited for mining laws OR could work in tandem with it


# Expeditions!
- fund expeditions slider!
    - depending on funding there is a % chance your archeologists discover new elf ruins that might unlock advancements from things discovered there!
        - maybe make a branch of advancements that player can see but cant unlock without discoveries so they have an idea of what they are after!
            - see if you can limit to just elf nations
        - "you found an ancient elven blade" martial stat +3
        - find portal pieces
